**Business Technology Consulting... that makes fucking sense.**

I’m an award-winning technology consultant, speaker, and philanthropist. I drive business owners to grow their company by giving them the strategy, technology, and sense to be a better brand. And I do it all for free!

In my decade of experience I’ve worked all angles of the technology industry, from developer to data architect to management to executive leadership. I’ve been the agency, and I’ve been the client.

I’ve undertaken great works with international nonprofits. I’ve contributed (unwittingly) to shady software firms and their predatory works. I’ve seen the best that the tech industry has to offer, and I’ve seen the worst.

Needless to say, I know my tech.

### What's Good?

I offer 100% FREE business technology mentoring. No sales. No gimmicks. No nonsense.

You deserve better. Let’s talk.
